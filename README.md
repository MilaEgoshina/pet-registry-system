## Pet Registry System

This program simulates a registry of pets in a pet-friendly environment. It allows users to manage and interact with different types of pets.

### Functionality
1. **Add a New Pet**


   Users can add a new pet to the registry by providing details such as name, type, and commands it can perform.

2. **Classify Pets**


   The program can automatically assign a pet to the correct class based on its type (e.g., dog, cat, bird).

3.  **View Pet Commands**


   Users can view a list of commands that a specific pet can perform.

4.  **Train Pets with New Commands**


   Users can teach pets new commands to enhance their skills and abilities.

5.  **Menu Navigation**


   The program provides a structured menu system for easy navigation and interaction.

6.  **Counter Class Feature**


   A counter class is implemented with an add() method to increment a stored integer value when a new pet is added. This is designed to work seamlessly with try-with-resources, throwing an exception in case of misuse.
